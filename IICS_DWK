Project end to end.
Dimentions & Facts arrangements
ETL tools using.
Datawarehouse which one ?
Project Code Deployment process?
How you do IL Loads.
How you perform DL laods.

As a developer what was you day to day activity.
how you used to design and develope...
How do you schedule that work...

For application usage or Dimentional modelling...


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PC Mapings/obects-> IICS migratation.
- not directly exporting, instead building logic in IICS....   (((( Normalized data : Star Scheama)))  ,,, Denormalized(Snowflake))
-- why : Logic directly import may be consuming lot of time, may not work, performance change, new bsiness scopes,
  	  not 1-1 migration,, new advancetage into mapping we are adding.....
	 PC --> IICS<  ,, equivalent mapping in IICS...
	 not just pic & drop.......

-- Project 1 : Dimentional modelling : Data for reporting,, view create for reporting team  + F.
--- P2 : For application usage : AWS RDS MYSQL for application usage... (Operational data for appplications)
--- Sources : FF, S3 files FF,,, daily basis load,,,, Oracle 12c, 
--> target : Snowflake............

Why IICS,,,,,,,


ETL day to day  : Agile methdeolog we follow, PI plan : 3 months, 1 spring - 2 weeks,,, Story points on requirmentss,,, we develop as per PO 
		   guidelince,,, 
		daily analyis, testing and development and requirmnent analysis with peers.... lower environment defect analysis and fixes...

Services IICS : Monitor ( mapping, taskflow status)
		Integration service to (Design and develop mapping)
 
Code Deployment :  1. IICS mapping object exports and importing in higher environment.. Admin deploy those code...	
		   2. Enhancement : in Production, we export and provide XML, they import it to prod..
				    ( GIT : Procedural , DDL & DML objects created in Git) m,,, higher environmenns processes migrated to higher 			through git itself....


		Mapping - MCT - Taskflow - Datatask..

How do you create parametetarization in IICS   -- > IICS secure agent where it is installed....
(through object directly we can use IICS))))
-> param file we use,,,, those param file it will used in the objects.....


Major task -> Data integration task,,, mass ingestion, scynchronization --> Delete the records in snowflake...

Performacr improvement  ;;
-- > views usage..
--> only for simplest logics... but for complex,,, through procedure,, and ceating view on top of that....

Work Schedule ??
--> IICS itself,,, 
Scheduler we create 
schedule1  -- > assign that to taskflows....


* Stream processing ::


Procedures how we creating ??
---> Procedures  logic 
 No logic in IICS,, all logics in procedures and just calling that...

--> our company had a plan , to swift to DB2,,, so instead of creating the whole logic agian they have a swift to just call these procedures direcly again in other tool,,, used cursors,, functionsss.... and case statements... etc.....
